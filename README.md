The dataset includes the following files:

-   `README.md`: This file

-   `CodeBook.md`: A file that describes the variables, data, and
    transformations performed to clean the data.

-   `runAnalysis.R`: Contains the commented script that does the
    analysis. The script must be run in a directory containing
    `features.txt`, `subject_train.txt`, `subject_test.txt`,
    `X_train.txt`, `X_test.txt`, `Y_train.txt`, and `Y_test.txt` from
    the project file. The script creates the file `dataSummary.csv`
    described below.

-   `dataSummary.csv`: Summary of the test data, with a header row. A
    181 Ã— 68 file containing the averages of each variable for each
    activity and each subject.
